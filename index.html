            <p id="description">I grew up in Milford, Connecticut but lived in Penang, Malaysia for a year for my senior year of 
                high school. Penang is the island where both my parents are from, so I spent lot of time with my grandma and extended 
                family during my time there. Family trips to Malaysia were few and far between because short trips were not worthwhile,
                due to the time and energy it takes to fly and adjust, and my older sister and I could not afford to be away from school
                or our activities for too long. I always cherish my time in Penang and with my family because of this. I currently live
                in Boston, MA as a second year student at Northeastern University studying Biology and Data Science. Having grown up
                with frequent trips to New York City, I've always preferred cities more than the suburbs. While Boston is not as
                bustling as New York City, I've enjoyed the accessibility and its beautiful skylines, especially by the water.
                I'll be spending my first summer Boston soon for summer classes, in which I am very excited to picnic in the
                Commons and go on runs through the Esplanade with the summer warmth. </p>
