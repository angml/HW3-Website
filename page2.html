                <h3>Yogurt Bowls</h3>
                <p>Breakfast is my least favorite meal because of the lack of options. I also don't find breakfast foods that filling, 
                which has become a recent priority since my classes run from 8 AM to 1:30 PM without breaks on most days. Lately,
                however, I have been obsessed with yogurt bowls for breakfast. Not only do I feel so aesthetic, Pinterest girl when I 
                make them, but I enjoy the customization that comes with my toppings. Depending on what I have and what I'm feeling, I 
                like to rotate between granola and nuts, sometimes I'll even choose both, and use different combinations of fruits. I 
                also like to add in cinnamon, goji berries, or a drizzle of honey for some additional flavor in my plain coconut yogurt 
                base. Since coming back from spring break, I've been feeling a bit sluggish and lazy, so yogurt bowls have been such an 
                easy fix in the morning, and I don't even feel like I'm eating the same thing because of my ever changing mix ins. </p>

                <h3>2000s Movies</h3>
                <p>Hulu has added some new movies, most of which of been on my "To watch" list for ages. After my
                    parents stopped paying for cable around middle school, I wasn't watching TV or movies that often.
                    Movies, in particular, always felt like they took too much time to watch outside of a planned theater
                    trip. I've been getting into movies since I've come to college due to my avid movie-goer friend. Now
                    I've been making my way through some classic 2000s movies on Hulu when I eat dinner, a habit my mom
                    would surely scold me for if she knew. I've watched Coyote Ugly, Bend it like Beckham, Mona Lisa's
                    Smile, and 500 Days of Summer in the last month. Something about 2000s rom-coms and coming of age
                    stories makes them so fun to watch. I think the nostalgia that comes with the soundtracks, actors,
                    and cinematography also makes it so enjoyable.  </p>

                <h3>Thai Basil</h3>
                <p>Thai food has been my new go to when I order take out. If you check my Uber Eats order history,
                    you would probably find multiple orders of either basil fried rice or drunken noodles. The flavor
                    of thai basil is so delicious, I love how fragrant it makes a simple fried rice or noodles dish.
                    Basil is also used in Thai curries, but I prefer Malaysian curries over them all. I've been trying
                    to cook basil fried rice on my own, since ordering Thai food for delivery is sadly unsustainable for 
                    my wallet, but I still can't get the same fragrant flavor. </p>

                <h3>Early Starts</h3>
                <p>While the thought of an 8 AM class three times a week was unattractive at the beginning of the semester, I've
                    slowly have come to like going to sleep earlier and waking up earlier. While I do feel like I grandma with
                    a bedtime of 10:30 PM in comparison to my friends, my new sleep schedule has made me feel so much more
                    energized and refreshed for the next days. I also like seeing the sun rise as I get up and the feeling
                    of more time in the day. Even on my days off, I still like to get up early since most of the time it sets
                    my body and mind up for a productive day. Especially when I am not rushing to get to class, the quietness of
                    a slow and early morning is so peaceful, it makes me want to challenge myself to get up before everyone else.</p>

                <h3>Journaling</h3>
                <p>Journaling is one of my favorite ways to manage my stress. When I feel like I need to vent or brain dump 
                    about things that I don't feel like sharing with family or friends, I let it all out in my journal. Sometimes I
                    write entries that go on for 4 pages and other times it's just one. My journal is not only an outlet for negative emotions. 
                    When I have the time or the mood, I'll write simply about how I'm doing and what's been going on in my life. I've never been
                    good about documenting or recording bits of my life, which makes it hard when I want to reminisce on memories, so the journal 
                    is also a way for me to relive my past experiences and see how much I've grown in character since I started writing.
